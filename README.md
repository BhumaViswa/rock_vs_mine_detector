# Rock vs. Mine Classification using Sonar Data

This repository contains Python code for performing rock vs. mine classification using logistic regression on sonar data. The code reads the sonar data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance. It also includes data visualization to understand the dataset.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you understand and run the code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python (version x.y.z)
- Required Python packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Installation

##Usage
Place your sonar data CSV file in the repository directory.

Open a terminal and navigate to the repository directory.

Run the Python script:
python rock_vs_mine_detection for submarine.ipynb

The script will display various visualizations and the accuracy of the logistic regression model.
Customization
You can customize the code to suit your needs:

Modify file paths to match your data location.
Adjust parameters in the train-test split and logistic regression sections.
